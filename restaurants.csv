Nicky's Thai Kitchen,40.452,-80.016,65,"Great Thai food. There is outside seating that is fantastic for nice days. Easy date night place. Casual attire is fine but the dining room looks nice enough for more formal evenings. If you want beer or wine with your meal, bring your own in a cooler! No corkage fees.","903 Penn Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15222"
Cap't Con's Fishhouse,26.705,-82.163,70,"Best bacon-cheeseburger in Lee County. I order the ""Cap't Bacon Burger"" with onion rings."," 8421 Main St, Bokeelia, FL 33922"
4 Rivers Smokehouse,28.59,-81.37,75,"Elite level BBQ. This is not a sit-down service place; you order at the counter and then take it to the outside patio seating area. The food is ready, so it's quick.If you like jalapenos, you must try the stuffed and smoked variety here. The sweet potatoes stood out also (warning: sweet enough to be dessert).I went with a group and everyone left stuffed and happy. They have dessert items too, which looked great, but in order to eat the sweets you'd have to make a special trip just for that. A three course meal here would make for a Man vs. Food episode. Should you find yourself hungry on I-4, this is worth going out of your way for.Update: Many trips later confirms that the best dinner item is the full rack of St. Louis ribs. They also make ice cream on-site. They are quite creative with it too, on this occasion they made a banana-pudding version that was very rich.","1047 S Dillard St, Winter Garden, FL 34787"
El Ranchito,28.93,-81.94,65,"The Texas Fajitas for two feature a mixture of chicken, steak and shrimp which is really enough to feed three. They also make their nachos my preferred way, individually placed toppings on 20 or so chips. Not just a pile of ground beef on top of a pile of chips. Every chip has the right amount of ""stuff,"" I order the nachos el carbon (steak).","1 Lagrande Blvd, Lady Lake, FL 32159"
Peach Valley Café,29.29,-81.043,60,Great breakfast/lunch spot. Think pancakes and sandwiches but gourmet. Their homemade apple fritters are a nice starter but be careful as they're also very filling.,"185 E Granada Blvd, Ormond Beach, FL 32176"
Don Vito's Italian Restaurant,29.211,-81.021,60,"Legit Italian food. The owner visited our table too much, but the calzones and pasta dishes were great. Recommended.","137 W International Speedway Blvd, Daytona Beach, FL 32114"
Rib City,26.648,-81.979,55,"Standard BBQ fare but their chicken tenders are made on-site and are fantastic. I don't even look at the menu anymore. I order one pound of the tenders, ""hot,"" with their spicy ranch. Light eaters should opt for 1/2 pound and a side salad. They're a (regional?) chain, so there are other locations around Florida.","80 Hancock Bridge Pkwy, Cape Coral, FL 33991"
Habana Café,27.748,-82.709,75,My favorite restaurant in the greater St. Pete/Tampa area. Legit Cuban food. I recommend the Drunken Shrimp appetizer and the Lechon Asado dinner. This is the first place I stop to eat when I visit.,"5402 Gulfport Blvd S, Gulfport, FL 33707"
India Palace,26.571,-81.87,60,One of the only Indian restaurants in SWFL. Well-lit dining area. The chicken tikka masala was tender and flavorful. Reasonably priced. ,"11605 S Cleveland Ave # 20, Fort Myers, FL 33907"
The Mynt,37.291,-121.99,NA,David Friedman recommends this Indian restaurant.,"5210 Prospect Rd, San Jose, CA 95129"
Boise Fry Company,43.612,-116.207,65,"Above average place for *fries* and a burger. Burger, fries and a drink runs about $9-10. They have 5-6 different varieties of potatoes with 4-5 different styles of cuts. Fries do no come pre-seasoned as they have a seasonings bar with flavored salts and sauces. The burger was clean, not greasy at all, spinach instead of lettuce and sweet onions that contrast the garlic aoili really well.","204 N Capitol Blvd, Boise, ID 83702"
Fat Head's Saloon,40.428,-79.982,60,"Best sandwiches & beer selection in Pittsburgh. Huge portions. College bar/young professional/ tourist scene. Appetizers: Buffalo Shrimp, solid, get the original wing sauce.
The Fried mushroom basket is huge & tasty, but greasy even by fried food standards.The Spinach & artichoke dip is above average. Chicken fingers are just OK, though not greasy. I prefer the perogies boiled rather than fried.","1805 E Carson St, Pittsburgh, PA 15203"
Six Penn Kitchen,40.442,-80.004,60,I recommend the buffalo chicken mac & cheese with gorganzola. My lunch companions raved about the pulled pork sandwich.,"146 6th St, Pittsburgh, PA 15222"
Grille on Seventh,40.443,-80.002,45,"Standard fare for bar/lunch. Burger wasn't anything special, but still solid and clean presentation. Not sloppy.","130 7th St, Pittsburgh, PA 15222"
