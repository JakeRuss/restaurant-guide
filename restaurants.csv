Nicky's Thai Kitchen,40.452,-80.016,65,"Great Thai food. There is outside seating that is fantastic for nice days. Easy date night place. Casual attire is fine but the dining room looks nice enough for more formal evenings. If you want beer or wine with your meal, bring your own in a cooler! No corkage fees."
Cap't Con's Fishhouse,26.705,-82.163,70,"Best bacon-cheeseburger in Lee County. I order the ""Cap't Bacon Burger"" with onion rings."
4 Rivers Smokehouse,28.59,-81.37,75,"Elite level BBQ.

This is not a sit-down service place; you order at the counter and then take it to the outside patio seating area. The food is ready, so it's quick.

If you like jalapenos, you must try the stuffed and smoked variety here. The sweet potatoes stood out also (warning: sweet enough to be dessert).

I went with a group and everyone left stuffed and happy. They have dessert items too, which looked great, but in order to eat the sweets you'd have to make a special trip just for that. A three course meal here would make for a Man vs. Food episode. 

Should you find yourself hungry on I-4, this is worth going out of your way for.

Update: A second trip confirms that the best dinner item is the full rack of St. Louis ribs. 

They also make ice cream on site. They are quite creative with it too, on this occasion they made a banana-pudding version that was very rich.
