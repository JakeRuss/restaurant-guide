Nicky's Thai Kitchen,40.452,-80.016,65,"Great Thai food. There is outside seating that is fantastic for nice days. Easy date night place. Casual attire is fine but the dining room is looks nice enough for more formal evenings. If you want beer or wine with your meal, bring your own in a cooler! No corkage fees."
Cap't Con's Fishhouse,26.705,-82.163,70,"Best bacon-cheeseburger in Lee County. I order the ""Cap't Bacon Burger"" with onion rings."
